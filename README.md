# Creative Bunny E-commerce Toy Shop

This a full-stack web application project built using React, Redux Toolkit, and Firebase. It is based on a real toy business currently selling on Trademe. All toy details and images are copyrighted by Creative Bunny Ltd.

Working on this project has strengthened my skills in the React and Redux frameworks, web responsiveness and accessibility, and has provided valuable practice with essential e-commerce features such as setting up add-to-cart, checkout, and Stripe payment functionalities.

## Responsiveness and Accessibility

The website is fully responsive and it adheres to accessibility standards as evaluated by the WAVE Evaluation Tool.

## This website is deployed by Netlify

## A Testing Ground for New Ideas

<div>

This project is also a playground for trying new
things. I’m currently in the process of adding **Passkey** to provide
users with a passwordless sign-in option. After having a taste of building a chatbot with Amazon Lex
during one of my AWS projects (see <a href="https://tiffwang.co.nz/awsproject/build-chatbot-with-amazon-lex" target="\_blank">
here</a>), going ahead, I’m interested in developing an **AI chatbot** for my e-commerce website by utilising Amazon Lex and training foundation models with Amazon Bedrock to enhance product recommendations and improve order checking using my own product data.

I aim not only to enhance the site but also to take the chance to experiment with some cool techs out there.

</div>

In the next phase of development, I plan to:

-   **Complete the footer links**: Add relevant pages to the links in the footer.
-   **Implement PassKey**: Users will have the option to create a Passkey for passwordless sign-in.
-   **Migrate to AWS**: As this e-commerce project evolves, such as integrating more features
    like order management and admin functionalities, transitioning to a more robust and scalable architecture
    becomes essential. Currently, the project uses Firebase for database interactions and Netlify
    functions for Stripe API calls directly from the front-end. Considering my future plan including
    implementing an AWS Lex chatbot and integrating additional order and admin-related APIs, I plan to migrate the
    project to AWS. This will not only provide the necessary infrastructure to improve the scalability and security
    of the application but also offer me a valuable opportunity to deepen my expertise with various AWS services.
