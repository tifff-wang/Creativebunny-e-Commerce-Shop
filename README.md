# Creative Bunny E-commerce Toy Shop

**Introduction**
<br />
This a full-stack web application project built using React, Redux Toolkit, and Firebase. It is based on a real toy business currently selling on Trademe. All toy details and images are copyrighted by Creative Bunny Ltd.

Working on this project has strengthened my skills in the React and Redux frameworks, web responsiveness and accessability, and has provided valuable practice with essential e-commerce features such as setting up add-to-cart, checkout, and Stripe payment functionalities.

## Responsiveness and Accessibility

The website is fully responsive and it adheres to accessibility standards as evaluated by the WAVE Evaluation Tool.

## This website is deployed by Netlify

## Future Enhancements

In the next phase of development, I plan to add the following features to further improve the functionality of the website:

-   **Order History and Status**: Users will be able to check their order history and the status of current orders. This feature will help customers track their purchases and view updates in real time.

-   **Admin Access for Order Management**: A dedicated admin interface will be implemented to allow site administrators to view incoming orders from customers and update order statuses as needed.
